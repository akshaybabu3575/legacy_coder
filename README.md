Hackathon prilims

Problem Statement:
Use of programming in nonconventional situations

What we understood:
There are situations where we all use programming to find solutions. But more than that there are places where these programming are not required as normal. Examples include, to calculate the balance from a shop or to calculate the number of mangoes in a mango tree etc. 

Idea:
Just we are going to design a program to calculate the no of mangoes in a mango tree.
